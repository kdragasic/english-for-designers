# Les Boucles: Giving a Small Salon a Voice Again  
*Freelance Project, 2025*

---

## How This Landed on My Desk

I didn’t go looking for this project — it found me.  
A family friend, running a small hair salon for over 15 years, reached out. She had loyal clients and strong routines, but her brand hadn’t changed since day one. No logo update, no consistent visuals, no real online presence. She needed help, but didn’t know where to start.

I saw an opportunity: not just to help her, but to test myself — to see how far I could take a project with a tight budget, an involved client, and no safety net.

## What Wasn’t Working

Les Boucles had history, but visually, it felt frozen in time.  
There was no system to her signage, the logo felt dated, and communication across platforms was inconsistent.  
The biggest challenge? She had taste, opinions, and expectations — but not a clear visual direction. That became my job.

## What I Took On

My goal wasn’t to reinvent her salon.  
It was to give her something that finally **felt like hers** — just better defined.

So I:

- Redesigned her logo from the ground up  
- Created a system for banners and printed materials  
- Designed a clean info board (with hours and Instagram handle)  
- Proposed a new black-and-white curtain for street visibility  
- Helped align her Instagram identity to match the new tone  
- Delivered all assets in print-ready form and consulted with the print shop

## How It Came Together

1. **Listen first.** I spent time understanding not just what she said — but what she meant.  
2. **Sketch & test.** I tried directions, some she rejected, some she liked. The goal was to evolve.  
3. **Decide & refine.** We settled on a look that matched her personality and customer base.  
4. **Package.** I prepared all deliverables for the printer and ensured everything worked offline as well as online.

## What I Learned

> *"A logo takes a day. Trust takes weeks."*

This project taught me how much of design is communication.  
It’s about balancing honesty with service, creativity with clarity.  
It also pushed me to deal with real-world limitations — file formats, print specs, material constraints — and still deliver something polished.

---

## The Outcome

The new identity is now being implemented.  
She’s proud of how her salon looks — finally.  
The banners are in production, the curtain is happening, and we’re already planning the next steps (business cards, website, templates).
