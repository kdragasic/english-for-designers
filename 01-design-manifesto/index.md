# My Graphic Design Manifesto
![very good|100x168,20%](20240904_121546.jpg)

I believe everyone has a different style when it comes to graphic design. It mostly depends on their hobbies, drawing style, sense of humor, personality, and so on. In this manifesto, I want to show you my style and how my personality appears in graphic design. I‚Äôm not here to write about **‚Äúhow to do graphic design correctly,‚Äù** because, for me, that question doesn‚Äôt exist. The most important thing for me is **creativity**.

I don‚Äôt think creativity has much to do with knowledge, but you can still practice it. But let‚Äôs start from the beginning: where does creativity come from? I‚Äôm not exactly sure which part of the human body it comes from‚Äîmaybe the heart, the brain, or even hormones. But one thing I do know is that when I‚Äôm creative, I feel confident. There‚Äôs no room for questions like **‚ÄúWhat if? Will they understand me? Is it good enough?‚Äù**

You have to trust yourself. If you don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs not really you.

Another aspect of creativity is having a good environment (whatever that means for you). You need to feel comfortable because emotions flow through your creativity. So we can sum this up in one phrase: **a confident mindset.** And of course, all those emotions mixed with a confident mindset need a form, and that form is graphic design. Graphic design helps us transform our ideas and expressions into a unified form.

Now, let‚Äôs get to the question: how can we practice creativity, or do we even need to? I think a graphic designer needs to practice creativity every day. It‚Äôs like a muscle ‚Äì the more you use it, the stronger it gets. And as you get older, you might find you have less creativity, which is why you need to keep exercising it. Unlike other fields, graphic designers don‚Äôt have specific exercises for creativity. For example, I‚Äôm also a musician, so I practice creativity through guitar improvisation, trying to connect it to well-phrased musical sentences. *Someone else might practice creativity by sketching in a notebook or creating their own Halloween makeup style.*

I‚Äôve realized that music and graphic design have something in common. They‚Äôre created in a similar way. You can be technically skilled, but the reason people listen to you or look at your work is because you‚Äôre interesting, and they might not even know why, but they like what you‚Äôre doing. This is called the **‚Äúwow effect,‚Äù** and it‚Äôs just as important in graphic design as it is in music. Be interesting. Make something interesting. When I used to play in a band before moving to Prague, I was always **100% sure of everything I played**. The frontman would often say, **‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you just played, bro, but it was freaking good, and I want it in the song!‚Äù**

---

But there‚Äôs another important factor to keep in mind: working with others. Understanding others and being on the same page is essential. Of course, there will be times when someone or something blocks your creativity. In those moments, remember that it‚Äôs a team project. In my opinion, there are two types of people: those who understand you but just want to do things their way ‚Äì which is fine because they‚Äôll eventually get it, even if they‚Äôre being stubborn. And then there are those who simply don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to explain. If that‚Äôs the case, it probably means they‚Äôre in the wrong place and don‚Äôt belong in graphic design. They rush into things without listening.

**Never work on graphic design unless you're 100% sure of what you're doing.**
